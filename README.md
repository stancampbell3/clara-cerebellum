# Clara Cerebellum ðŸ§ 

Clara Cerebellum is a modular Rust workspace that exposes the CLIPS expert system via a secure, scalable REST API. It supports both ephemeral and persistent session modes, with robust lifecycle management, sandboxing, and observability. Designed for inference orchestration, rule-based automation, and structured decision support.

## ðŸ§© Architecture Overview

- **Subprocess-first, FFI-ready**: Initial integration uses a REPL subprocess with framed I/O and protocol enforcement. Future evolution targets FFI for lower latency and structured data exchange.
- **Session lifecycle**: Create â†’ Load â†’ Evaluate â†’ Inspect â†’ Persist â†’ Reload â†’ Shutdown.
- **Dual-mode execution**: Stateless ephemeral sessions or long-lived persistent sessions with save/reload support.
- **Security-first**: RBAC, scoped tokens, command filtering, sandboxing, and audit logging.
- **Observability**: Metrics, tracing, structured logging, and health endpoints.
