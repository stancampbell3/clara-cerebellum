# Clara Cerebrum Session Summary
## Project Overview
Clara Cerebrum is a Rust-based API server that provides CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) expert system functionality via HTTP endpoints. The system uses Actix-web for the HTTP server and manages CLIPS subprocesses for rule-based inference execution.

## Current Architecture
- **Frontend**: Actix-web HTTP server with REST API
- **Backend**: CLIPS expert system subprocesses managed per user session
- **Configuration**: TOML-based config with environment variable interpolation
- **Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels
- **Persistence**: Session management with eviction policies

## Key Components
- `clara-api`: Main HTTP server with handlers for sessions, evaluation, and health checks
- `clara-session`: Session lifecycle management with configurable limits
- `clara-clips`: CLIPS integration layer (C code with Rust bindings)
- `clara-core`: Shared types and error handling
- `clara-config`: Configuration loading and validation
- `clara-persistence`: Data storage and migration
- `clara-security`: Authentication and sandboxing
- `clara-metrics`: Observability and tracing

## Recent Issues Resolved

### 1. Route Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Compilation error with `actix_web::post` macro usage
**Solution**: Updated route configuration to use `web::post()` function instead of the macro
**Files Modified**: `clara-api/src/routes/health.rs`

### 2. CLIPS Binary Location
**Problem**: CLIPS binary not found at expected path `./clips/binaries/clips`
**Solution**: CLIPS was built in `clara-clips/clips-src/core/clips` but expected in `./clips/binaries/clips`. Copied the binary to the expected location.
**Status**: CLIPS binary now accessible, but build process integration incomplete

### 3. Session Initialization Timeouts
**Problem**: CLIPS subprocess initialization hanging during startup
**Solution**: Simplified initialization to assume readiness after 1-second delay instead of attempting handshake communication
**Files Modified**: `clara-api/src/subprocess/repl.rs`

### 4. Subprocess Communication Issues
**Problem**: Eval handler timing out with no response from CLIPS subprocesses
**Solution**:
- Fixed stdin handle access (was trying to access consumed handle)
- Simplified command execution to collect all output during timeout period
- Removed sentinel-based output framing
**Files Modified**: `clara-api/src/subprocess/repl.rs`

## Current Status
- ✅ Server starts successfully
- ✅ Session creation works
- ✅ Health endpoints functional
- ❌ Eval endpoints timing out (CLIPS subprocess communication incomplete)
- ❌ CLIPS build process not integrated into Rust build system

## Next Steps Needed
1. **CLIPS Build Integration**: Integrate CLIPS makefile into Cargo build process
2. **CLIPS Communication**: Determine correct CLIPS invocation mode (batch vs interactive)
3. **Command Execution**: Implement proper CLIPS command execution and output capture
4. **Error Handling**: Improve subprocess error detection and recovery
5. **Testing**: Complete integration tests for eval functionality

## Technical Notes
- CLIPS subprocesses are spawned per user session with piped stdin/stdout/stderr
- Current approach assumes CLIPS runs in interactive mode but may need batch mode
- Subprocess communication uses blocking I/O with timeouts
- Session management includes configurable concurrent limits and eviction policies

## Configuration
Default config expects CLIPS binary at `./clips/binaries/clips` with sentinel marker `"__END__"`

## Dependencies
- Rust 1.70+ (via rust-toolchain.toml)
- CLIPS 6.4.2 (C codebase in clara-clips/)
- Actix-web for HTTP server
- Tokio for async runtime
- Various logging and serialization crates
