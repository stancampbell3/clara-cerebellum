CLIPS Session Persistence Strategy (Rust REST Server)

    Emit a structured JSON snapshot before exit At the end of each transaction, inject a CLIPS command that:

    Serializes the current session state (facts, rules, agenda, modules)

    Formats it as a JSON string

    Prints it to stdout with a recognizable marker (e.g., SESSION_STATE)

Example CLIPS snippet: (printout t "SESSION_STATE " "{ \"facts\": [ ... ], \"rules\": [ ... ] }" crlf) (exit)

You can generate this JSON using CLIPS’s string formatting functions (str-cat, str-assert, etc.) or define a rule that walks the fact list and emits a JSON-like structure.

    Parse and store the structured output In your Rust server:

    After subprocess exits, scan stdout for the SESSION_STATE marker

    Extract and parse the trailing JSON string

    Store it in your persistence layer (file, S3, SQLite, Redis, etc.) keyed by sessionId

This gives you a clean, versioned, portable snapshot of the session state.

    On reload, rehydrate the session When resuming a session:

    Retrieve the saved JSON snapshot

    Reconstruct the CLIPS environment by re-asserting facts, re-loading rules, and restoring modules

You can dynamically generate a CLIPS script from the JSON: (assert (foo bar)) (assert (baz qux)) (load "rules.clp")

    Version your persistence format Include a top-level version field in the JSON: { "version": "1.0", "facts": [...], "rules": [...], "modules": [...] }

This allows you to evolve the format and write migration logic if needed.

    Optional: Use CLIPS’s native persistence

    (save-facts "path" LOCAL) to persist facts

    (load-facts "path") to reload

    (save "env.clp") to persist rules and constructs

Tradeoff: native formats are fast but opaque and harder to debug or version.

Summary of Options:
Approach	Pros	Cons
JSON via (printout)	Human-readable, versionable, portable	Requires custom formatting logic
save-facts / load-facts	Native, fast	Opaque, harder to debug/version
Hybrid (JSON + native)	Best of both	More complex to implement
